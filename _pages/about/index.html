I am a second-year Biomedical Engineering Master’s student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My current research is aligned with improving current clinical procedures (such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)) used in treating neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. I am also currently working on my Master’s Thesis which involves exploring brain connectivity using evoked potentials in epilepsy patients.</p> <p>My fascination with neural circuits grew from my background in electrical engineering, where I found how many dynamics of electrical systems mirrored the brain’s intricate networks. I did my undergraduate degree in electronics and communication engineering. For my bachelor’s thesis, I created a framework for movement analysis using wearable sensors, to help athletes with rehabilitation and performance enhancement.
