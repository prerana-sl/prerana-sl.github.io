My fascination with neural circuits grew from my background in electrical engineering, where I found how many dynamics of electrical systems mirrored the brain's intricate networks. I did my undergraduate degree in electronics and communication engineering. For my bachelor's thesis, I created a framework for movement analysis using wearable sensors, to help athletes with rehabilitation and performance enhancement.
