Hello! I am a second year Biomedical Engineering Master's student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. An electrical engineering by trade, neural circuits fascinate me, and hence research interest in neural engineering. My current research involves clinical studies, and the functional exploration of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and epilepsy, especially in the fieled of deep brain stimulation (DBS).
