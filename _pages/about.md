Hello! I am a second-year Biomedical Engineering Master's student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am currently a member of the <a href = "https://oprilab.bme.umich.edu/">Opri Lab</a> where my research focus is improving current clinical procedures (in specific, Deep Brain Stimulation) used in treating neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. I am also currently working on my Master's Thesis which involves exploring brain connectivity using evoked potentials in epilepsy patients.

My fascination with neural circuits grew from my background in electrical engineering, where I found how many dynamics of electrical systems mirrored the brain's intricate networks. My background comes from an undergraduate degree in electronics and communication engineering. For my bachelor's thesis, I created a framework for movement analysis using wearable sensors, to help athletes with rehabilitation and performance enhancement. If interested in learning more about the projects I'm involved with, please click [here](prerana-sl.github.io/cv) for my resume! 

In my free time, I watch movies and explore cafes (I'm from Chennai, South India, and I LOVE [coffee(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee)). I quite enjoy writing fiction, and you can find some of them [here](prerana-sl.github.io/misc)! I am also a trained classical dancer, in the Indian dance form [Kathak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathak#:~:text=Kathak%20(Devanagari%3A%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%95)%20is,through%20dance%2C%20songs%20and%20music.).
